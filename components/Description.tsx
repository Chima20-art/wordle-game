        The rules are very simple: You need to guess the hidden word (5 letters)
        in 6 tries. To get started, just type any word on the first line. If the
        letter is guessed correctly and is in the correct place, it will be
        highlighted in green ðŸŸ¢, if the letter is in the word, but in the wrong
        place - in yellow ðŸŸ¡, and if the letter is not in the word, it will
        remain gray ðŸª¨.{" "}
